## About the Dataset
The dataset is from Zillow.com. 
The Market Heat Index measures the balance between supply and demand in the for-sale housing market. A higher index indicates a stronger sellerâ€™s market. It is derived from a combination of engagement metrics and listing performance data, offering insights into current market trends. The index is calculated separately for single-family homes and condos. For more details, refer to the methodology.

The dataset is collected from **940 cities in the United States** from **2018 to 2024** on a monthly basis. 

## Purpose of the Project
This project aims to analyze and identify the city with the highest Market Heat Index from 2018 to 2024. A higher Heat Index indicates greater market demand, providing valuable insights for prospective homebuyers to make informed decisions about their market choices.

## Additional Comment
The dataset is also separated into tables based on year for further analysis.
